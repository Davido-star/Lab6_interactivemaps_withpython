# Lab6 Interactive Maps With Python.  
Mapping directly into a python notebook is neat and if you’re good at it, colud remove the need for a user interface. Folium helps with this too by the bringing together of python and mapping library, leaflet. For this exercise we use folium to display the number of Starbucks within zip codes of LA county, CA using a leaflet choropleth map.  The choropleth map by zip code skews the distribution of Starbucks by a random geography, there are better ways to display this information that relate to a more human activity than mail delivery. Instead of a choropleth map to show the distribution of Starbucks in LA county, we can simply map the Starbucks. Using folium again, the Lat and Long locations of every Starbucks are plotted on the map. The second method tells a story that isn’t through the lens of a zip code and just shows where the stores are. Looking good.

This next map uses folium to map unemployment rates in a useful choropleth manner.
